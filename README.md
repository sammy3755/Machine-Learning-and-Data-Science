##Introduction
Machine learning and data science have revolutionized the way we extract valuable insights from data. This repository aims to provide practical examples and implementations of machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques using popular datasets. Each project focuses on a specific problem or task, allowing you to explore various aspects of machine learning and data science.

##Projects
1. Iris Classification
This project demonstrates a classic example of a classification problem using the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is widely used for learning and teaching purposes due to its simplicity and clarity. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of various classification algorithms to predict the class labels of iris flowers accurately.

2. Breast Cancer Classification
In this project, we tackle the task of breast cancer classification using the Breast Cancer dataset. The dataset contains features computed from breast mass images, and the goal is to classify tumors as malignant or benign. The project covers data exploration, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation, providing a comprehensive understanding of the classification process.

3. Survival Analysis on Titanic Dataset
Survival analysis is an essential technique in data science, especially when dealing with time-to-event data. In this project, we perform survival analysis on the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic and whether they survived or not. We explore various survival analysis techniques to analyze factors influencing survival and create predictive models for survival probability.

##Dataset Descriptions
This repository utilizes three popular datasets:

1. Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning and statistics. It consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of Iris flowers. The task is to classify the flowers into their respective species based on these measurements.

2. Breast Cancer Dataset
The Breast Cancer dataset contains various features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The task is to classify the tumors as either malignant or benign based on these features.

3. Titanic Dataset
The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used for survival analysis. It includes information about passengers on the Titanic, such as age, sex, ticket class, and whether they survived or not. The dataset is used to explore factors influencing survival and to build predictive models for survival probability.
